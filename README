  Build with ./configure --enable-jlink
  You'll probably need to install libusb-dev (apt-get/ubuntu) or libusb-devel (yum/fedora) first.
  * openocd.cfg file included in repository root 
  To see openocd connects to the chip:
  * Run openocd from a terminal at repository root (openocd.cfg present)
